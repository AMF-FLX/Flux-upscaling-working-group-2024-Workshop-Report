Flux upscaling working group / 2024 Workshop Report: Remote Sensing and Fluxes Upscaling for Real-world Impact

This repository contains materials from the 2024 Remote Sensing and Fluxes Upscaling for Real-world Impact workshop focused on analyzing and integrating remote sensing and flux data using Jupyter Notebooks. The workshop featured a series of presentations, which are outlined in the agenda included in this repository. 

The repository is organized as follows:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: A collection of notebooks providing tutorials and examples for working with remote sensing and flux data, designed to be run on Google Colab.
- **Presentations**: Slides and supporting materials from the workshop presentations, following the agenda.

To run the notebooks, simply open them in Google Colab and follow the instructions. This repository aims to provide a resource for participants and others interested in learning about remote sensing and flux data analysis and integration.
